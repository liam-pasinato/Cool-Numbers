# Cool-Numbers
An algorithm that outputs numbers that are able to be square rooted AND cube rooted within a user-defined range (positive numbers). 
After a valid list is inputeted, the system uses list manipulation to search through a list of numbers that can be square rooted and a list of numbers that can be cube rooted, identifying and outputting a new list of common numbers between lists. These common list values in the new list are what is meant by cool numbers.
