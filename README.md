# Cool-Numbers
An algorithm that outputs numbers that are able to be square rooted AND cube rooted within a user-defined range (positive numbers). 
After a valid list is inputted, the system uses list manipulation to search through a list of numbers that can be square rooted and a list of numbers that can be cube rooted. the algorithm then identifies and outputs a new list of common numbers between lists. 
This new list contains the values of all cool numbers within the range.
